    <h1>My Life Thusfar...</h1>
    <h2>The Early Days</h1>
    <p>In the beginning, <strong>the Earth's crust cooled</strong>, there was a boy, born in Hanoi, in a happy little family, with 2 sisters.</p>
    <!---content to be revised later.-->
    <p>The boy was very happy, and he was grateful that his family was a happy one. But it was still early, and life has <em>so much more</em> for him.</p>
    <p>The boys have a few commitments and responsibilities that he must embrace:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>He is the future family head, and it was impressed upon him that he has ties to his hometown.</li>
        <li>He is the son of two engineers, and he must lived up to their expectation of achivements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Therefore, his childhood, though mostly happy, was not unrestrained. He must commit himself to discipline and commitment:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Studying comes first.</li>
        <li>Only hang out with friends his parents will approve.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>He has many interests, as boys of his age typically do. But some of them were suppressed, to make ways for <em>interests</em> which his father believed to be more beneficial to his development.</p>
